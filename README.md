# fingerprintproject

# Key Communication Features Added:
Shared Data Service:

Centralized class that manages all data operations

Simulates API calls with localStorage persistence

Used by both user and admin components

Real-time Notifications:

Admins get notified when users submit break requests

Users get notified when admins approve/reject requests

Notification badge updates in real-time

Break Request Workflow:

User submits request → Admin sees it immediately

Admin takes action → User sees status update

Both sides can view request history

Data Synchronization:

All components use the same data source

Changes made by one role are immediately visible to others

Local storage ensures persistence between sessions

Common UI Components:

Consistent alert/notification system

Shared date formatting and display logic

Unified status badges and styling

# Implementation Notes:
Real-World Adaptation:

Replace the DataService with actual API calls to your backend

Implement proper authentication for API requests

Add error handling for network issues

Security Considerations:

Add proper validation for all user inputs

Implement role-based API endpoints

Secure sensitive user data

Additional Features:

Add WebSocket for real-time updates

Implement push notifications
